1. Run data_wrangling.ipynb to clean the data files first and produce new files test_new.cvs & train_new.cvs
2. Run Predict_NN.ipynb to predict the survival. The accuracis predictions for both Test and Train data sets should be around 85%


Notice, without cleaning the data and using usual stat methods, the accuracy of the survival prediction is only in %60 range.
